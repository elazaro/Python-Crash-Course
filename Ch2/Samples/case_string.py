# some question should come with this very simple code, first: who's Ada Love-
# lace, ;) google it and show respect.
# second: is Python OO, or only partially supporting objects, because the title
# function looks pretty much like a method.
# third: is this implicit variable a String object? what other methods this ob-
# ject supports.
# fourth: is the title behaviour customizable?

person = "ada lovelace";
print(person.title());

# these other methods are the typical upper case and lower case converters.

person = "ADA LOVELACE";
print(person.lower());

person = "ada lovelace";
print(person.upper());

# differently to other languajes, this methods, upper and lower are not named
# toUpper or toLower, is this a convention?
